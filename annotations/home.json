By claiming that they are “people like himself,” he is implying that he believes that he is similarly crucial to South Africa’s success.\nWhat is ironic about this is the fact that the whites are the ones ruling South Africa, but are abusing the natives and using them for slave labour. Therefore they are really the ones who are really the “backbone of [their] nation,” but Mr Jackson is ignorant to this and writes them off as worthless.",

It is not unlikely that he would view the wealthy (as is implied by “golden”) European colonisers as being the “pure” ones who deserve to run the country.\nTherefore, the whiskey could be symbolic of him himself, which could also explain why he seems so pleased and at home in this hotel.",
